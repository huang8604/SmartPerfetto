# Agent Runtime Architecture

[English](agent-runtime.en.md) | [中文](agent-runtime.md)

<!-- i18n-headings: paired -->

SmartPerfetto separates model SDK mechanics from Perfetto analysis capability.
The HTTP and CLI session layers depend on the shared `IOrchestrator` contract;
the concrete runtime is selected from the request provider, Provider Manager,
or environment.

| Runtime | SDK | Provider family | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-agent-sdk` | Claude Agent SDK | Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex, DeepSeek, Anthropic-compatible gateways | Default runtime; supports local Claude Code auth fallback for source runs, MCP server, verifier, and sub-agent behavior |
| `openai-agents-sdk` | OpenAI Agents SDK | OpenAI, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible gateways | Native OpenAI runtime; adapts the same SmartPerfetto tools as function tools |
| `pi-agent-core` | Pi Agent Core | custom only | Optional public runtime; real model configurations reuse the shared SmartPerfetto prompt/tool/report pipeline, while fake-stream remains smoke-only; does not enable `.pi` discovery, package extensions, shell tools, or file tools |
| `opencode` | OpenCode server / SDK | custom only | Optional public runtime; uses explicit OpenAI-compatible or OpenCode model configuration, request-scoped SmartPerfetto MCP tools, and a hardened isolated OpenCode server; does not read local OpenCode login/project state or enable built-in file/shell/web/edit tools |
| `qoder-agent-sdk` | Qoder Agent SDK / `qodercli` | custom only or env | Optional public runtime; SDK is an opt-in optional peer, uses a local Qoder CLI login or PAT, exposes request-scoped SmartPerfetto MCP tools, and isolates private-knowledge streams/sessions/snapshots |

## Entry Points

HTTP analysis:

```text
POST /api/agent/v1/analyze
  -> AgentAnalyzeSessionService.prepareSession()
  -> createAgentOrchestrator()
  -> ClaudeRuntime.analyze() | OpenAIRuntime.analyze() | PiAgentCoreRuntime.analyze() | OpenCodeRuntime.analyze() | QoderRuntime.analyze()
```

Resume and scene reconstruction use the same runtime factory:

```text
POST /api/agent/v1/resume
POST /api/agent/v1/scene-reconstruct
  -> createAgentOrchestrator()
```

The npm CLI is a standalone terminal product exposed as `smp` /
`smartperfetto`. It does not start the Web UI, but it reuses the same runtime,
MCP tools, Skills, reports, and session snapshots.

## Runtime Selection

Priority, highest first:

1. `providerId` from the request or session.
2. The Provider Manager active provider.
3. `SMARTPERFETTO_AGENT_RUNTIME`.
4. Default `claude-agent-sdk`.

`SMARTPERFETTO_AGENT_RUNTIME` only accepts `claude-agent-sdk`,
`openai-agents-sdk`, `pi-agent-core`, `opencode`, or `qoder-agent-sdk`. Provider names such as
`deepseek` or `openai` are not valid runtime values. Provider Manager active profiles
override env fallback, and a resumed session keeps the provider/runtime it was
created with.

Provider mapping:

| Provider type | Runtime | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` / `bedrock` / `vertex` / `deepseek` | `claude-agent-sdk` | Claude/Anthropic |
| `openai` | `openai-agents-sdk` | OpenAI Responses |
| `ollama` | `openai-agents-sdk` | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions |
| `custom` | selected by `connection.agentRuntime` or `connection.openaiProtocol` | explicit configuration; Pi Agent Core, OpenCode, and Qoder are custom-only |

Provider connection fields map to runtime-specific env:

| Fields | Runtime | Env |
|---|---|---|
| `claudeBaseUrl` / `claudeApiKey` / `claudeAuthToken` | `claude-agent-sdk` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` |
| `openaiBaseUrl` / `openaiApiKey` / `openaiProtocol` | `openai-agents-sdk` | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_AGENTS_PROTOCOL` |
| `piAgentCoreModulePath` / `piAgentCoreModelJson` / `piAgentCoreSystemPrompt` | `pi-agent-core` | `SMARTPERFETTO_PI_AGENT_CORE_MODULE_PATH` / `SMARTPERFETTO_PI_AGENT_CORE_MODEL_JSON` / `SMARTPERFETTO_PI_AGENT_CORE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` |
| `openCodeSdkModulePath` / `openCodeModelJson` / `openCodeSystemPrompt` plus OpenAI-compatible endpoint fields | `opencode` | `SMARTPERFETTO_OPENCODE_SDK_MODULE_PATH` / `SMARTPERFETTO_OPENCODE_MODEL_JSON` / `SMARTPERFETTO_OPENCODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` plus `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL` when model JSON is omitted |
| `qoderAccessToken` / `qoderCliPath` / `qoderModel` / `qoderSystemPrompt` | `qoder-agent-sdk` | `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `QODERCLI_PATH` / `QODER_MODEL` / `SMARTPERFETTO_QODER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` |

## M10 Independent Feedback Triage

Agent-assisted GitHub feedback does not resume the main analysis session. New
RunManifests may persist `providerSnapshotHash` at completion. When the user
selects the feedback CTA, the backend resolves the persisted source run again
and requires the currently available provider snapshot to match that hash
exactly. It never reads a later active provider or falls back to another
runtime.

Claude/Anthropic-compatible source runs use a no-tool Claude SDK call for
triage. OpenAI/OpenAI-compatible source runs use a lightweight Chat
Completions call. Both receive only bounded public source context and do not
share the analysis SDK session. Pi Agent Core, OpenCode, Qoder, legacy
manifests, unavailable credentials, snapshot drift, or invalid model output
use an explicit deterministic fallback in V1 and are never presented as if the
same Agent reviewed the result. See
[Agent-Assisted GitHub Feedback](../getting-started/agent-assisted-feedback.en.md)
for the user-visible contract.

canonical shared layer.

## Tool Layer

SmartPerfetto analysis capability is registered through
`createClaudeMcpServer()` and described through `McpToolRegistry`: SQL
execution, Skill invocation, SQL schema lookup, planning/hypothesis tools,
artifacts, memory, code-aware lookup, baselines, and comparison tools.

Claude runtime exposes these tools as an in-process MCP server. OpenAI runtime
does not duplicate tool logic; it reads the same `McpToolRegistry` and adapts
tool descriptors into OpenAI Agents SDK function tools. Pi Agent Core uses
request-scoped native tools built from the same shared descriptors, the shared
system prompt, planning/hypothesis tools, and the same route-owned
finalization/claim-verification/report pipeline without turning SmartPerfetto
into a Pi coding-agent harness. OpenCode runs a hardened isolated server and
bridges request-scoped SmartPerfetto tools through a per-analysis MCP bridge;
its built-in project discovery, file, shell, web, and edit tools are disabled
or denied. Qoder uses the SDK's in-process MCP bridge with built-in SDK tools
disabled and projects every answer token through the shared private-output
guard before SSE emission. Runtime outputs normalize into the same SSE events,
`AnalysisResult`, and HTML report contract, although their SDK/server resume
and streaming mechanics differ.

The tool surface is not a fixed-size list. Quick/full mode, artifact store
availability, codebase permission, `referenceTraceId`, comparison context, and
runtime allowlists shape the request-visible set.

## Concurrency, Observability, And Admission

Concurrency fails closed by default. A runtime/session permits only one active
analysis execution. Tools are exclusive unless a commutative read is explicitly
marked and admitted for the current request. Each trace processor instance
still has one SQL worker, so tool overlap cannot execute same-trace/processor SQL
concurrently; work on different processors/traces or admitted read-only
preparation may overlap. Processor creation and recovery are single-flight, and
a cancelled stale execution cannot overwrite newer session state.

The backend records real phase spans, first output, tool scheduler wait, and SQL
queue/execution timing in the internal `RunManifest.performance` field. This
`RuntimePerformance` receipt is not projected into public SSE. The public stream
also does not expose admission-grade model, provider snapshot, provider usage,
or performance fields. The receipt supports internal attribution and controlled
benchmarks; by itself it does not prove real-provider speed or accuracy.

Performance branches are controlled by the strict maintainer-only
`SMARTPERFETTO_ADMITTED_RUNTIME_CANDIDATES` boundary and default to no admitted
candidates. The value may contain only a comma-separated, whitespace-free,
duplicate-free list from `task4` through `task9`. Whitespace, an unknown item, a
duplicate, or any malformed value invalidates the whole setting. It is not a
Provider Manager, UI, or provider env option, and benchmark artifacts never
activate it automatically:

| Candidate | Scope |
|---|---|
| `task4` | Reuse one quick-evidence/focus preflight across all five runtimes |
| `task5` | Use bounded fair overlap for explicitly commutative read tools across all five runtimes; all other tools remain exclusive |
| `task6` | Overlap independent Claude/OpenAI preflight DAG nodes |
| `task7` | Load independent Pi SDK/provider startup concurrently and enable quick parallel-batch scheduling; descriptor/tool gates still serialize exclusive work |
| `task8` | Read OpenCode messages/status together and use adaptive polling |
| `task9` | Overlap Qoder Skill-registry and SDK startup |

After `task5` is admitted, its safe-read policy is enabled by default.
`SMARTPERFETTO_SAFE_TOOL_CONCURRENCY=false` is a rollback to exclusive
execution; it cannot bypass a missing `task5` admission. Cache single-flight,
execution isolation, cancellation cleanup, receipts, and deterministic repairs
are correctness/observability foundations and remain active independently of
performance-candidate admission.

Shipped defaults remain serial: genuine deterministic admission harnesses for
all five adapters are `NOT CONFIGURED`, and bounded real-provider base/candidate
A/B has not run, so performance/accuracy admission is `INCONCLUSIVE`. Synthetic
scorer data validates scoring mechanics only and cannot enable a candidate.
When real-provider validation cannot run, record `NOT AVAILABLE` or
`NOT CONFIGURED` precisely. Qoder needs a PAT or local `qodercli` login in
addition to BYOK. Unit, type, build, and deterministic gates are not substitutes
for real-provider evidence.

The Pi Agent Core real-model path reuses SmartPerfetto scene strategies, system
prompt assembly, SQL/Skill tools, planning/hypothesis tools, artifacts, and the
route-owned quality/finalization/report pipeline. It does not read `.pi`
project configuration, package extensions, shell tools, or file tools. Provider
Manager only exposes it for `custom` providers with explicit Pi model JSON or
equivalent env configuration. `SMARTPERFETTO_PI_AGENT_CORE_FAKE_STREAM=1` is
smoke/test-only and must stay labeled capability-limited.

The OpenCode path is also custom-only. It can use `SMARTPERFETTO_OPENCODE_MODEL_JSON`
with `providerID` / `modelID` / `baseUrl` / `apiKey` fields, or fall back to
OpenAI-compatible `OPENAI_*` env/provider fields. SmartPerfetto does not reuse
the user's OpenCode CLI login, config, or project extensions; rollback is
switching the custom provider or `SMARTPERFETTO_AGENT_RUNTIME` back to
`claude-agent-sdk` / `openai-agents-sdk`.

The Qoder path is custom-only in Provider Manager and also supports an explicit
env selection. The SDK is not installed by default; users must review its terms
and opt in through `qoder:install -- --accept-terms` or an explicit module path.
The `resolveModel` BYOK policy combines `QODER_BYOK_API_KEY`,
`QODER_BYOK_PROVIDER`, `QODER_MODEL`, and optional base URL, style, and light
model values; partial configuration fails closed. BYOK changes the model
provider only and never replaces Qoder PAT or local `qodercli` authentication.
Provider Manager accepts the four BYOK values only through a Qoder custom
profile's `custom.envOverrides`; it cannot override the CLI, SDK module, or
worker path. The BYOK key reaches only the SDK `resolveModel` callback, not the
SDK subprocess environment, diagnostics, or plaintext snapshots. Provider,
base URL, and style remain non-secret snapshot inputs, while key changes update
the secret fingerprint used by provider pinning, resume, external issue, and
Self-Evolution proof boundaries. Public sessions may resume by Qoder SDK session
id. A run authorized for private codebase or external knowledge never resumes
or stores that opaque provider session, and its intermediate state is excluded
from durable snapshots.

## Source-Aware Runtime Parity

The five production runtimes do not implement separate source policies. They
share the strategy-owned source-use prompt, actual `SourceUseDecisionV1` state
from the common MCP registry/handlers, and
`finalizeSourceAwareAnalysisResult` on success, partial, max-turn, and error
terminal paths. Without a current-run accessor, model-authored source decisions
or bindings are removed. A `pending` or `attempted` decision cannot be
presented as a successful result.

In full analysis, selected source plus a queryable trace anchor requires a
bounded lookup or a controlled non-use status recorded before lookup.
Trace/Skill/SQL proves occurrence and `CodeRef` proves mechanism.
`corroborated` requires verified same-claim trace occurrence plus
`provider_send` body/indexed evidence; `metadata_only` is locate-only.

One canonical safe projector carries the same decision and binding through
initial and replayed SSE, HTML reports, CLI JSON/Markdown/HTML,
analysis-result snapshots, and report/snapshot APIs. Web chat further reduces
it to a current-run receipt without `CodeRef`. No surface retains absolute
roots, snippets, search queries, or model-authored free-text binding reasons.

The deterministic five-runtime execution/finalization gate and A0–A4 semantic
gate prove the product contract, not real-provider model quality. Claude,
OpenAI, Pi, OpenCode, and Qoder require separate repeated acceptance when
credentials are available. Unavailable authentication is reported as
`REAL PROVIDER NOT AVAILABLE` and cannot be replaced by unit tests or fixtures.

## Analysis Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fast` | Lightweight system prompt, core evidence tools, and a runtime-specific quick budget |
| `full` | Full tools, plan gate, notes, artifacts, and quality gates |
| `auto` | Non-negotiable context rules followed by the lightweight classifier; ambiguous requests use full analysis |

Reference traces, codebases, and private knowledge sources may require full
context. An explicit quick request must not silently discard those required
capabilities.

## SSE Events

All runtimes emit the same SmartPerfetto streaming update categories to the
route layer:

| Event | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `progress` | Phase change |
| `thought` | Intermediate reasoning or phase guidance |
| `agent_task_dispatched` | Tool invocation started |
| `agent_response` | Tool result |
| `answer_token` | Final-answer token |
| `conclusion` | SDK conclusion arrived |
| `analysis_completed` | HTML report generated; terminal event |
| `error` | Failure |

The route layer emits `analysis_completed` only after report generation, so the
report path does not depend on a specific SDK.

## Final Result And Quality Artifacts

All runtimes normalize their raw output into a shared `AnalysisResult`, then
run through the same quality and persistence chain:

```text
runtime result
  -> agentResultNormalizer
  -> finalReportContractGate
  -> evidence contract / claim verification / identity resolutions
  -> HTML report / CLI turn files / analysis-result snapshot
  -> frontend visible projection
```

`final_report_contract` comes from strategy frontmatter. Known verifier
misdiagnosis rules also come from strategy frontmatter through
`verifier_misdiagnosis_patterns`: runtime loads scene-aware patterns, global
patterns can be shared across scenes, regexes must compile under
`validate:strategies`, and severity is limited to `warning` or `info`. Claim
verification and identity resolution depend on structured Skill/DataEnvelope
evidence. The frontend may filter noise from the visible chat conclusion, but
it must not remove provenance needed by reports, CLI artifacts, or snapshots.

## Sessions And Resume

The route layer calls `orchestrator.takeSnapshot()` and restores with
`restoreFromSnapshot()`.

Claude runtime persists the Claude SDK session id. OpenAI runtime persists
OpenAI history, the last response id, and reserved run state. Responses API can
resume with `previousResponseId`; Chat Completions-compatible providers resume
from full history.

Pi Agent Core, OpenCode, and Qoder store runtime-specific opaque state only where the
adapter supports it. They still preserve provider/runtime identity so resume,
reports, and snapshots do not silently switch to another engine.

Snapshots also carry final-result quality fields such as conclusion contracts,
claim verification results, and identity resolutions so resume, report export,
and analysis-result comparison can reuse them.

Raw trace comparison sessions must also persist `referenceTraceId`,
`comparisonSource`, and `comparisonReportSection`. A comparison session cannot
silently downgrade to single-trace mode or switch to a different reference
trace. Claude/OpenAI SDK session keys must be read and written with the
comparison identity, and Pi/OpenCode/Qoder runtime state must preserve the same
provider/runtime identity.

## Platform Boundaries

- Source runs and the npm CLI require Node.js `>=24 <25`.
- Portable packages bundle Node.js 24, backend runtime files, committed
  `frontend/`, and the pinned trace processor.
- Docker does not read host Claude Code local auth; use Provider Manager or env
  provider configuration.
- Qoder is absent from default Docker/portable/npm installs until the optional
  SDK peer is explicitly installed after its terms are accepted.
- Runtime/provider/session changes must be checked against Web UI, CLI, API,
  reports, Docker, and portable packages. See
  [`../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md`](../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md).

## Health Check

Authenticated `GET /api/runtime-health` exposes the selected runtime. Public
`GET /health` returns only liveness and version:

```json
{
  "aiEngine": {
    "runtime": "openai-agents-sdk",
    "providerMode": "openai_responses",
    "diagnostics": {
      "protocol": "responses",
      "model": "gpt-5.4-mini"
    }
  }
}
```

This distinguishes provider connectivity from the runtime that will actually
execute analysis.
